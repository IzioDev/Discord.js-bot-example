# Another discord.js bot example!

 - Introduction
 - Basics

----------


## Introduction :

This is just another discord.js bot example. This is for the person who need examples to learn, maybe you could have some answers here, so I share!

As you could notice, this is not well commented/documented cause there are not many things in this, and this is just the basics, this will be updated every weeks I hope!

----------

## Basics :

The project is very basic for now.
You have :

 - bot.js, which is the main file.
 - a commands directory, to create a new command, just create a new file.
 - a db directory, where I would like to put all the DB stuff and nowhere else.
 - a config.json (where you need to set the token and db stuff)
 - a sql file (need to be imported)

----------

Feel free to open suggestion. But please, don't ask for help about installing stuff, you need to go there for that : https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome
